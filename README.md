# Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

<img src="images/machine-learning-brain.jpg" width="1000" height="450">

## Project Overview
In this project, I used Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.
I employed the following different techniques:

- Oversample the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the `ClusterCentroids` algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the `SMOTEENN` algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier`.

I will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
